I am a final year Computer Science PhD student at Rochester Institute of Technology ([RIT](https://www.rit.edu/computing/study/computing-and-information-sciences-phd)), Rochester, NY, USA, working under the supervision of [Professor Wang](https://www.rit.edu/cblwang/). Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.

Broadly I am interested in Deep learning research. My PhD research focus is on Deep learning, Scientific Machine-Learning, Representation Learning and Generative Models. I was a 2X Machine Learning Intern at [Spotify](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here), NY, USA, working on using LLMs for Recommendation Systems.
