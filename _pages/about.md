I am a final year PhD student in Computer Science at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/study/computing-and-information-sciences-phd), working under the supervision of [Professor Wang](https://www.rit.edu/cblwang/). I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.

My research is deeply rooted in Deep Learning, Scientific Machine Learning, Representation Learning, and Generative Models. During my PhD, I have explored diverse applications of machine learning, particularly focusing on projects in healthcare that aim to enhance diagnostics and personalized patient care.

I completed two internships at [Spotify](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here) in New York, USA, where I worked on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Recommendation Systems.

Away from the screen, I enjoy aerial yoga üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, hiking üèîÔ∏è, and cooking üçù.
